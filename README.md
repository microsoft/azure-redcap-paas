### Details

This template automates the deployment of the REDCap solution into Azure using managed PaaS resources. The template assumes you are deploying a version of REDCap that supports direct connection to Azure Blob Storage. If you deploy an older version, deployment will succeed but you will need to manually provision NFS storage in Azure, and delete the new storage account. For NFS, consider:

- <https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-netapp-files/>
- <https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/softnas.buurst_nas>
- <https://learn.microsoft.com/samples/azure/azure-quickstart-templates/nfs-ha-cluster-ubuntu/>

To deploy REDCap source to Azure App Service, you must supply your REDCap Community site credentials which the deployment automation will use to pull your copy of the REDCap source directly from the community site.

> NOTE: These values will be stored within the Azure App Service as configuration settings. Once your deployment has succeeded, you should navigate to your Azure App Service resource and delete or empty out the values so that they aren't stored here.

- ARM template deploys the following:
  - Azure Web App
  - Azure DB for MySQL (1)
  - Azure Storage Account
  - (optional) SendGrid 3rd Party Email service (2)

(1) Review <https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/flexible-server/concepts-service-tiers-storage> for details on available features, regions, and pricing models for Azure DB for MySQL.

(2) SendGrid is a paid service with a free tier offering 25k messages per month, with additional paid tiers offering more volume, whitelisting, custom domains, etc. There is a limit of two instances per subscription using the free tier. For more information see <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/store-sendgrid-php-how-to-send-email#create-a-sendgrid-account>. The service will be accessed initially using the password you enter in the deployment template. You can click "Manage" on the SendGrid service after deployment to administrate the service in their portal, including options to create an API key that can be used for access instead of the password.

If after deployment, you would instead like to use a different SMTP relay, edit the values "smtp_fqdn_name", "smtp_port", "smtp_user_name", and "smtp_password" to point to your preferred endpoint. You can then delete the SendGrid service from this resource group.

If you use Exchange Online (part of the Microsoft 365 Suite), you can follow these steps to set it up and use it as an SMTP relay for this service: <https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/how-to-set-up-a-multifunction-device-or-application-to-send-email-using-microsoft-365-or-office-365>

### Setup

This template will automatically deploy the resources necessary to run REDCap in Azure using PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) features.

**IMPORTANT**: _The "Site Name" you choose will be re-used as part of the storage, website, and MySql database name. Make sure you don't use characters that will be rejected by MySql._

After the template is deployed, deployment automation will download the REDCap ZIP file you specify, and install it in your web app. It will then automatically update the database connection information in the app.

> NOTE: The database will not be initialized; therefore, REDCap will not be usable until then. See the [Post-Setup](#post-setup) section below on how to initialize the database.

With the download and unzipping of REDCap application, the entire operation will take between 12-16 minutes.

If you need to connect to the MySQL database using the MySQL client, you will need to open the firewall to your managed MySQL instance and allow connections from the location where you will run the client. Here are the instructions:
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/quickstart-create-mysql-server-database-using-azure-portal#configure-a-server-level-firewall-rule>

(Add your current IP address by clicking "+ Add My IP")

Once you've opened the firewall, you will need your database name. The credentials are those you supplied in this template. The name is available from the portal where you updated the firewall rules:

![alt text][mysql]

<https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/flexible-server/how-to-connect-tls-ssl>

### Post-Setup

After the deployment and installation of REDCap has completed, you will need to initialize the database manually. The application gets deployed via Kudu which calls the `deploy.sh` script. After deployment, the `postbuild.sh` script extracts the MySQL commands from REDCap's installation page (`install.php`) and drops the output into a file called `install.sql`. Both `install.sh` and `install.sql` files will be dropped into `/home` directory.

Once the source control deployment of REDCap has completed, you will need to SSH into the running container:

![ssh](images/ssh.png)

Execute the following command from the `/home` directory:

```sh
bash install.sh
```

![ssh](images/install.png)

It will take a few minutes to execute the SQL.

Once you regain access to the console, you can navigate to the root of your app service and confirm everything shows green on the REDCap Configuration Check page - with the exception of CronJob status which you may have to manually invoke. If anything displays on that page in red or yellow, it is recommended that you perform a "Restart" of the Azure "App Service". This needs to be done due to the fact that some necessary server environment settings get changed after the initial deployment, but restarting the App Service will load the service with the intended settings. Everything should be fine after that initial restart though.

### Note about REDCap "Easy Upgade"

The "Easy Upgrade" feature in REDCap 8.11.0 and later is currently _not_ supported when deploying a REDCap instance on Azure. Support for "Easy Upgrade" on Azure is expected to come at a later time in a future REDCap release.
